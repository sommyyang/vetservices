							<h5 class="blocktext">Pets are becoming a big part of people’s lives every day. Sometimes it is easier for some people to schedule appointments online and not have to wait on the phone to do it. 
								Our application will help clients with scheduling an appointment online with an animal hospital for their pets. 
								It’s mostly used for services that are not emergency situations such as wellness check, behavior consultation, dentistry, etc.</h5>
							<h5 class="blocktext">Mobile devices and apps are becoming more prevalent as an everyday use. Sometimes it’s even easier for some people to visually see a calendar and know how appointments 
								can fit into their schedules. With the usage of seeing a calendar filled with available times and a doctor’s name, it can help lessen the anxiety some people have with 
								trying to remember someone’s name, trying to schedule, talking on the phone, etc. Clients will be able to see a calendar in their own account, showing all their accepted 
								appointments and previous appointments. This application will help the organization with lessening the amount of scheduling calls (which they are still able to continue to receive) 
								and have more important calls come through such as for emergency services.</h5>
